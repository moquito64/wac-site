## We Are Ready. 

In this day in age technology and the gizmos/gadgets/dodads that make the modern world function many struggle to make sense of it all, let alone keep up with the changes.
Now there is a lot going on in the world of tech and truthfully its all a bit complex.

I'll be honest with you. The main thing you need to know about us is that we love what we do. It's real as simple as that. This isn't a sales tactic or a gushy customer story bit. It's in fact the truth at the core of all our work. We don't just think fixing a symptom of a larger problem is a solution. Here at wolf and crow we hunt for the root cause and tell you the truth behind the complexity.

We have worked in the Hilo, Hawaii's Tech sector for a combined 10 years now. We have experience in office, enterprise, and residential setting for technology consultations and repairs. Currently we are a small team located in the heart of Hilo.
